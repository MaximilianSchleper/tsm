    - ✅ As a user, I can toggle coverage display on/off (only when animation is paused).
    - ✅ As a user, I can see coverage zones automatically hidden during animation for performance.

4.  **Interactive Satellite Selection**
    - ✅ As a user, I can click any satellite to view its live details and position.
    - ✅ As a user, I can click coverage zones to select the corresponding satellite.
    - ✅ As a user, I can view real-time ECEF coordinates for selected satellites.
    - ✅ As a user, I can see satellite names, IDs, and visual feedback for selection.

5.  **Advanced Simulation & Animation**
    - ✅ As a user, I can view satellite orbits as dashed polylines with color-coding by orbital plane.
    - ✅ As a user, I can see satellites animated in real-time using accurate orbital propagation.
    - ✅ As a user, I can control simulation playback (play/pause) using Cesium's timeline controls.
    - ✅ As a user, I can observe a full 7-day simulation with optimized 2-minute time steps.
    - ✅ As a user, I can see satellites with distinct colors: Cyan (0° RAAN), Orange (90°), Lime (180°), Magenta (270°).
