### Refined High-Level User Stories

These user stories reflect the simplified globe requirement while emphasizing the dynamic, LeoLabs-inspired visualization with a sci-fi aesthetic.

1. **Set Up Constellation As a satellite operator**, I want to input my satellites' orbital data so that I can see them on a 3D globe with basic country outlines.
   - Add up to 10 satellites using Two-Line Elements (TLEs).
   - View a list of satellites with names and basic orbit details.
2. **Input Goals (Define Imaging Tasks)As a satellite operator**, I want to specify imaging tasks with locations and time windows so that the software can schedule them.
   - Add up to 50 tasks with latitude, longitude, time windows (e.g., start/end times in UTC), and optional priority.
   - See a task list with edit/delete options.
3. **Run Optimization (Generate Schedule) As a satellite operator**, I want a schedule that assigns tasks to satellites so that I can plan operations efficiently.
   - Generate a schedule using a simple algorithm (e.g., assign tasks to the first available satellite with visibility).
   - Display the schedule as a list with satellite, task, and time.
4. **Visualize Results As a satellite operator**, I want an interactive 3D visualization of a simplified Earth globe with country outlines, showing satellite orbits and tasks, inspired by LeoLabs, so that I can explore the schedule dynamically with a sci-fi flair.
   - Display a 3D globe with basic country outlines (no high-res imagery), zoomable and rotatable.
   - Show satellite orbits as glowing, curved paths around Earth (e.g., neon blue or purple lines).
   - Mark task locations with glowing pins or zones on the globe.
   - Include a timeline with play/pause controls to animate satellite movements and task activations (e.g., a pulse or beam effect when imaging occurs).
   - Allow clicking a satellite to show a popup with details (name, current position, assigned tasks).
   - Enable a "track" mode to lock the camera on a selected satellite's movement.
   - Use a dark, sci-fi-themed UI with neon accents for a futuristic, *The Expanse*like aesthetic.
5. **Demo Mode As a potential user**, I want a one-click demo with preloaded data to instantly see the tool's value.
   - Load a sample constellation (e.g., 3 satellites) and tasks (e.g., 5 imaging targets).
   - Auto-generate and visualize the schedule on the 3D globe with animation.

### Refined Implementation Plan

This plan eliminates the Cesium Ion token by using a self-hosted or procedural globe while enhancing the visualization to capture LeoLabs' interactivity and your sci-fi vision. It's broken into small, manageable tasks for a developer, running client-side with Next.js, Resium, satellite.js, and Tailwind CSS for easy Vercel deployment.

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js (with TypeScript)**: Framework for UI and logic, ensuring a fast, deployable app.
- **Resium/CesiumJS**: 3D globe rendering, using a simplified imagery layer (no Cesium Ion).
- **Satellite.js**: Client-side orbital calculations from TLEs for satellite positions and visibility.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling for a dark, neon, sci-fi UI.
- **Natural Earth (Optional)**: Static imagery for basic country outlines, bundled with the app.
